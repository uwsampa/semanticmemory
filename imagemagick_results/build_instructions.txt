Applications need to be statically compiled with debug symbols.

To build ImageMagick with debug symbols:

./configure CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG CFLAGS="-g -O0 -static" CXXFLAGS="-g -O0 -static" LDFLAGS="-g -static"

Run the ImageMagick "convert" tool to do canny edge detection on the image I made. Can't remember what the commands for that are...
